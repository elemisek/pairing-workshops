# Pairing workshops

The purpose of the application is to try one of the pair programming styles - Driver & Navigator.
The app already contains some implementation, but there are missing parts. Also, feel free to refactor it.

## Useful commands

* Installation:
  ```
  bundle install
  ```

* Running tests:
  ```
  rspec spec/
  ```

## Usage

```
bin/parse path_to_your_file.log
```

Or with specified sorting type:
```
bin/parse path_to_your_file --order=unique
```
